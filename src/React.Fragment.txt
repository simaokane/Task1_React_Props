1. Using <React.Fragment>...</React.Fragment>, we can add a parent tag to our JSX elements without adding an additional node to the DOM.

When working with React, there are cases where you will need to render multiple elements or return a group of associated elements. Here's an example:


function App() {
  return (
    <h1>Hello React!</h1>
    <h1>Hello React Again!</h1>
  );
}

If you try to run your application with the above code, you will encounter an error indicating that adjacent JSX elements must be wrapped in a wrapper tag. This means that you need to wrap both elements in a parent div.

function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Hello React!</h1>
      <h1>Hello React Again!</h1>
    </div>
  );
}

This will correct the error, but there is a degree of risk involved. You're adding an extra node to the DOM, which isn't necessary. In a case like this, where the above is a child component that will be enclosed in a parent component, it becomes a problem.


function Table() {
  return (
    <table>
      <td>This is a Table Component</td>
      <Columns />
    </table>
  );
}

function Columns() {
  return (
    <div>
      <td>Hello React!</td>
      <td>Hello React Again!</td>
    </div>
  );
}

When you're working with React, there are cases where you'll need to render several elements or return a group of associated elements. Here's an example:

function App() {
  return (
    <h1>Hello React!</h1>
    <h1>Hello React Again!</h1>
  );
}

  return (
    <div>

      <h1>Hello React Again!</h1>
    </div>
  );
}

This will correct the error, but there is a degree of risk involved. You're adding an extra node to the DOM, which isn't necessary. In a case like this, where the above is a child component that will be enclosed in a parent component, it becomes a problem.

function Table() {
  return (
    <table>
      <td>This is a Table Component</td>
      <Columns />
    </table>
  );
}

function Columns() {
  return (
    <div>
      <td>Hello React!</td>
      <td>Hello React Again!</td>
    </div>
  );
}
The resulting HTML code for the Table component will not be valid because of the extra div added.

function Table() {
  return (
    <table>
      <td>This is a Table Component</td>
      <div>
        <td>Hello React!</td>
        <td>Hello React Again!</td>
      </div>      
    </table>
  );
}

Let's take a look at a better way to solve this problem using React Fragment, which won't add any extra nodes to the DOM. The syntax looks like this:

function Columns() {
  return (
    <React.Fragment>
      <td>Hello React!</td>
      <td>Hello React Again!</td>
    </React.Fragment>
  );
}
You can also use the short syntax <></> to declare a Fragment.

function Columns() {
  return (
    <>
      <td>Hello React!</td>
      <td>Hello React Again!</td>
    </>
  );
}
